I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this program.

1. Bugs: 
- Heuristic correctness because I could not gague the correctness of the algorithm in part C. I had to just play it multiple times to make sure it works.
- How to sort the dictionary correctly because it is an object so it was not easily accessed. I used list comprehension for it.
- The heuristic itself when calculating the consecutive rows. It was a bug where there was some index not being correct. I fixed it by adding some functions to the board class that calculates wins in a rows.

2. Help:
- I talked about the ideas to some people including: Arnab, Maria, Paola, Anas

3. Problems:
- What took the most time were the loggins themselves but there was not any problems that I got stuck too long

4. Heuristic:
- I just used a current winning consecs that is less than the main consect to win condiction. This is similar to the heuristic that the doc gave

5. The documentation was very helpful.
